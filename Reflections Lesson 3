When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Sometimes I work from home


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It aligns with the philosophy of only committing changes after you've made a
solid change

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone copies a repo and can copy from local to github or vice versa
A fork copies a repo but only goes from github to github
A branch is where you go off on a new development path.
