How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You can see any changes quickly and see potential locations where a bug will get introduced

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    YOu can focus on where you need to make changes or what needs to be revised

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It forces you to think about what to do; also prevents dumb shit from being changed without a care

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Consistency between groups of files that may or maynot depnd on each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To see commit logs and difference between commit histories
    green shows added lines and red shows deleted lines

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You will always have the previous version saved and can easily revert to it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Data analysis projects
